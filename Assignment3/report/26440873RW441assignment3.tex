\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

\section{\textbf{Background}}

\subsection{\textbf{Datasets}}

The recurrent neural networks were trained and evaluated across five distinct datasets to provide a comprehensive assessment of their performance across diverse tasks.

\subsubsection{\textbf{AMD Stock Data}}

The AMD dataset records AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) stock data over a period of 40 years. The dataset records 10098 instances of 7 variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Date}: Date the instance was recorded in the format 'yyyy-mm-dd'.
    \item \texttt{Open}: The price at which the stock first traded on the trading day.
    \item \texttt{High}: The highest price the stock reached during the trading day.
    \item \texttt{Low}: The lowest price the stock reached during the trading day.
    \item \texttt{Close}: The final price of the stock when the market closed on that day.
    \item \texttt{Adj Close}: The closing price adjusted for corporate actions like stock splits or dividends.
    \item \texttt{Volume}: The total number of shares traded on that day.
\end{itemize}

For this problem, \texttt{Adj Close} is the response, instead of \texttt{Close}, because it reflects the true economic value of the stock by incorporating adjustments, these adjustments ensure the data more accurately reflects the stock market trends.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:amd_adj_close} displays how AMD's adjusted closing price fluctuated from 1980 through 2020. The series is clearly non-stationary, with periods of sharp growth and declines. The overall trend is upward, even though there are multiple crashes. Most notably around the early 2000s dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. The defining upward trend, showing rapid growth, started in 2020.

To formally asses stationarity, and Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was conducted. The ADF test is a widely used statistical procedure for detecting unit roots in time series data. If a series has a unit root, it means it behaves like a random walk and is thus non-stationary. The ADF statistic of the AMD stock dataset yielded a p-value of 0.05468, meaning the null hypothesis is not rejected at the 5\% significance level and the series is non-stationary.

The series also exhibits no clear periodic seasonal structure, which is visually evident. Overall the dataset demonstrates the characteristics of a typical non-stationary financial time series, with long-term upward trend.
